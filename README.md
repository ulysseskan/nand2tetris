Notes on my [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course progress

For those that don't know, nand2tetris is a twelve-part course in fundamental computer engineering
created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. It steps students through the creation of a computer from
the ground up, starting with NAND logic gates and ending with an operating system capable of running
a complicated program like Tetris.

* Includes prep, notes, and code I wrote to help me along the way
* Does NOT include direct solutions to the problems you're asked to solve in the course
